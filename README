InCense

InCense is a research kit to facilitate behavioral data gathering from
populations of mobile phone users. It includes a mobile application,
a context database and a desktop graphic environment. The mobile
application gathers, preprocesses and sends data to the context database.
The desktop graphic environment simplifies the creation of a new study
and the selection of sensors and filters of data to be used in the mobile
application.
